# GRAPHOPT
Constrained-optimization based parallelization of irregular graphs

Commands to run the main core algorithms:

`python main.py --tmode sparse_tr_solve_full`

`python main.py --tmode psdd_full`

Note that the paths to sparse matrix files, psdd etc. have to be setup in ./global.py for the above commands to work.
